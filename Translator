# Translator
# This file will be the backend of the translation program
# and will house the necessary calls and objects for the
# translator. The file will consist of at least 2 classes
# for the translator to operate. It will take in the 
# desired text selected by the user and then input it into
# the translator. The input will be linked to the output
# word-word and sentence-sentence. This will allow for the
# program to adapt the the users changes and corrections.
